Principles of play:

- Anyone can join in so long as everyone treats everyone else well. If you do not then I will not accept pull requests from you.

- Please keep the FS tidy!

- We are emulating several different space agencies/launch carriers collaborating, so please come up with a unique name, flag for your company or space agency, naming schemes &c. (yay comic relief) Even potentially paint schemes if you want, I'm sure we can implement them!

- If someone specialises in something, then try specialising in something else (Do what you're good at, in my case probably spaceplanes!), no point in putting your beautiful hab on a bad launcher when someone else has a wonderful heavy lifter.

- Competition is also awesome, it will lead to innovation. Just keep it friendly please!

- Chat is in the Github "issues" section - say that you have a payload to launch then your launch contractors can offer their sevices and you can pick according to cost, payload capability, safety(!) &c.
